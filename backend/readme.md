 **HW8 Description:**
 
This repository contains backend of the movie MERN project that you can search for a movie, write reviews for a movie, change and delete the reviews for a movie. And you can also choose your favorite movies and rank them in the order you like. You have to log in to add favorites movies and write reviews.

For hw8, I have changed my backend to get a separate database query that queries for a specific collection of movies(the favorite list includes the id, title, poster for each movie) across the entire database. 

I also create a favorite page in the frontend that can get the favorite list of movies and used DnD library so the users can drag and drop the movies in any order they want and stay in the order they want.
When the user logged out, the favorite page disappeared and redirect the user to the home page. When the user logged in, the favorite page appears. When there is no movie in the favorite page, it would say "You haven't chosen any favorites yet".
